# The Scenario
TinyHat.Me is an up and coming startup that provides an API to allow users to try on tiny hats via a REST API. The startup is looking to you to ship some awesome new features! While we have a frontend working to serve tiny hats from a database, the startup is looking to add some exciting new features. Today, as the newest backend engineer at TinyHat.Me, you are going to be learning how the microservices work, as well as fix a few outstanding bugs from our customers!

## The Outline
### üî® Building
- What are Microservices?
- Let's write the `/email` and `/moderate` services!
- Hello? Are you there? How do the pods communicate?
### üöÄ Deploying
- What even is Kubernetes, the whale, and containers?
- Containerizing with Docker
- EKS: it does not stand for Ecstatic Kittens Surfing
- Let's spring into action: Deploying Continuously with Github
- Routing traffic with Route53 and DNS configuration
### üêõ Debugging
- Yikes! Innappropriate hats are on the website!
- We have complaints about the `fetch` feature...
- The moderate can't moderate?
